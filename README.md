# background-process-demo
Demo using tensorflow, bodyPix and mediapipe for realtime image background processing

It supports only blur background effect for now. Additional backgrounds will be added soon!

This demo uses mediapipe work from [this](https://github.com/ouchunrun/virtual-background) and [this](https://github.com/Volcomix/virtual-background) repos. Thanks for their authors [ouchunrun](https://github.com/ouchunrun) and [Volcomix](https://github.com/Volcomix/)!
